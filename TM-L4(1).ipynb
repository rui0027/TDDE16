More specifically, we ask you to implement a vectorizer that represents each sentence as the sum of its word vectors – a representation known as the **continuous bag-of-words**. Thus, given that spaCy&rsquo;s word vectors have 300 dimensions, each sentence will be transformed into a 300-dimensional vector. To represent a sentence pair, the vectorizer should concatenate the vectors for the individual sentences; this yields a 600-dimensional vector. This vector can then be passed to a classifier.\n",
